Hi Wes,

A CTF environment has been created for you to demonstrate your skill set. The environment is similar to a typical corporate environment that you would interact with during an internal penetration test. The objectives are as follows:

- Find the Flags - There are eight (8) flags to capture. The flags are in an MD5 format. The MD5 flags were randomly generated so no need to attempt to reverse them.
- Escalate Privileges to Domain Admin
- Find DeathStar Technical Manual
- Locate sensitive data such as PII, CC, and SSN data

**Scope:**

All hosts in the [10.7.0.0/24](http://10.7.0.0/24) are in scope except for 10.7.0.1.  
  

**Note:** You might not complete all of the objectives and that’s perfectly ok.

You will have five (5) hours to complete the CTF. You will have 24 hours from the end of the CTF to write the report. After the CTF has ended, access to the CTF will be severed. To save on time, I suggest not updating Kali. However, feel free to add any tools you like.

  
  

**Report**

The report will evaluate your writing abilities and your ability to convey risk based on the findings identified during the test. In this scenario I am the client and you are the consultant.

Report Requirements:

- Provide screen shots of each flag identified and the location where it was found. The MD5 hash of the flag must be shown in the screen shot
- Identify vulnerabilities

- Provide enough screenshots to support the vulnerabilities you’ve identified
- Provide the location where the vulnerability was discovered
- Include recommendations to mitigate the risk

- Include a narrative

- Summary of assessment
- Path of privilege escalation to Domain Admin

- Provide a screen shot of the DeathStar Technical Manual. The screenshot should also include the location where it was found

Attached is an OpenVPN profile to access the CTF portal.
